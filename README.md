# A-Z Handwritten Alphabets Neural Network
Computer Assignment #5 Phase 2, Artificial Intelligence Course, University of Tehran

Neural networks are one of the most powerful machine learning structures that have found many applications in various scientific and industrial fields in recent years due to the increasing computing power of processors. One of the advantages of these algorithms is that it makes it possible to construct any desired derivative function using only two hidden layers of neurons. Therefore, it is possible to implement and learn nonlinear functions with their help. Due to the recent advances in this structure and its increasing use in industry, very powerful frameworks have been offered to facilitate the creation of very complex and highly efficient neural networks. In this project, we intend to investigate some issues related to neural networks with the ```TensorFlow``` library and using the ```Keras``` high-level interface.

In this project, we intend to use neural networks to recognize the **English alphabet** based on their image.

[A-Z Handwritten Alphabets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format) is a collection of handwritten images of the English alphabet. This dataset contains 372,450 images along with their corresponding labels.
